Auto-priority-by-severity-and-probability is a custom field in Jira that is used to automatically set the priority of a ticket based on the severity and probability of the issue. This custom field can be used in Jira Software.

Severity and probability are two important factors that are used to determine the priority of a ticket. Severity refers to how critical the issue is, while probability refers to the likelihood of the issue occurring. By using this custom field, Jira can calculate the priority of a ticket based on these two factors, which can help teams better manage their workload and ensure that the most critical issues are addressed first.

To use the auto-priority-by-severity-and-probability custom field, users can define the severity and probability levels for their organization. These levels can be customized based on the specific needs of the organization, and can be mapped to priority levels within Jira. For example, a high severity and high probability issue may be assigned a priority of "Critical", while a low severity and low probability issue may be assigned a priority of "Low".

Once the severity and probability levels have been defined, the auto-priority-by-severity-and-probability custom field will automatically calculate the priority of a ticket based on the severity and probability values selected by the user. This can help teams save time and ensure that they are addressing the most critical issues first.

Overall, the auto-priority-by-severity-and-probability custom field is a powerful tool that can help organizations better manage their workload and ensure that critical issues are addressed in a timely manner. By leveraging this custom field, teams can improve their efficiency, reduce the risk of issues going unnoticed, and ultimately provide better service to their customers.
